- The intro overlay must dismiss through CSS independently of React hydration so a delayed preview cannot hide the story indefinitely.
- Keep the scroll playhead in useStoryProgress and layered/video media in StoryLandscape; native scrolling remains user-controlled while scene changes and video frames follow one eased playhead.
- Creative chapters use the existing scene playhead and StoryLandscape media variants rather than separate scrolling systems, keeping navigation and transitions consistent.
- Living chapter surfaces render in a lifecycle-managed Canvas 2D module through StoryLandscape; continuous media bypasses video seeking so idle motion and native scrolling coexist.
- Scene audio uses opt-in browser Web Audio with playhead crossfades, visibility suspension and unmount cleanup; never autoplay sound or couple it to scrubbed video tracks.
